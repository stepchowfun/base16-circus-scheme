## Installation instructions

You can install Circus for various programs using the tools listed [here](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16#template-repositories). For example, you might use [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell) and [base16-vim](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim) to install the color scheme for your terminal and Vim, respectively.

## Build instructions

You don't need to build the color scheme if you just want to use it as is. If you want to customize the colors, you can build the scheme as follows:

1. Install [Toast](https://github.com/stepchowfun/toast).
2. Run `toast`. This will generate a `circus` directory containing the color scheme.
